# Predicting-Mobile-App-Success-and-Ratings-through-Machine-Learning
This predictive model aids developers in making informed decisions about their app's features, thereby enhancing the likelihood of favorable user ratings and increased installations.
Contrary to traditional business models, where financial gains are
the primary indicator of success, the app industry often prioritizes
user ratings and the number of installations. These metrics provide
valuable insights into user satisfaction and popularity, which, in
turn, influence an app's success in the competitive market.
To gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing an app's
success, Kaggle emerges as a valuable resource. Kaggle, aplatform known for hosting datasets and fostering collaborative
data science projects, provides a comprehensive dataset containing
attributes such as app name, category, reviews, ratings, and
pricing. Leveraging this dataset, a predictive model can be
developed using Python libraries and packages like sklearn,
statsmodel, seaborn, and matplotlib.
The analysis would involve extracting meaningful features from
the dataset, considering aspects such as app category, user reviews,
and pricing. Through the application of machine learning
algorithms, particularly those available in sklearn, predictions can
be made regarding the app's rating. This predictive model aids
developers in making informed decisions about their app's features,
thereby enhancing the likelihood of favorable user ratings and
increased installations.
